title: How to Add Comments to Rails
---

Last time we've created [voting system](/weekly-rails/2014/08/05/how-to-add-voting-to-rails-app.html) for our app. This time I want to show you how easy can be adding comments with **commontator** gem

## Why to Use Commontator Gem for Adding Comments

Because it allows to:

* Showing comments count
* Adding, editing, deleting comments
* Is customizable
* You can easy add voting to comments with acts_as_votable 

## How to Install Commontator 

First add Commontator to your Gemfile

#### Gemfile

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'commontator'
{% endhighlight %}

Then install it with Bundler:

{% highlight sh %}
bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can run following to create commontator configuration and migration.

{% highlight sh %}
rake commontator:install
{% endhighlight %}

Now move migration to database:

{% highlight ruby %}
rake db:migrate
{% endhighlight %}

## Adding Commontator's route

Now you can add route.

#### config/routes.rb

{% highlight ruby %}

mount Commontator:Engine => '/commontator'
{% endhighlight %}

## How to Use Commontator in Models

Let's assume you've got two models right now. First is **User** and second is **Link**.

We want to from model User to be able to post comments, so add this line to User model.

#### app/models/user.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
class User < ActiveRecord::Base

acts_as_commontator

{% endhighlight %}

And we want to show comments under each link, so we'll add acts_as_commontable helper to our model.

#### app/models/link.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
class Link < ActiveRecord::Base

acts_as_commontable
{% endhighlight %}

## Showing Comments in a Browser

So now when we've added helpers to models, we can create commontator thread. We want to show comments for each link, so we will use link variable for our thread.

Let's assume you've got index action in links_controller like this:

#### app/controllers/links_controller.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
class LinksController < ApplicationController

def index
  @links = Link.all
end
{% endhighlight %}

Add this code to show commontator thread in links_path

#### app/views/links/index.html.slim

{% highlight html %}
- @links.each do |link|
  = commontator_thread(link)
{% endhighlight %}

Now if you look at this in browser you should see comments count.

If you click on show comments, new comment link will appear.

Now fill in form and look at your comment. Looks nice isn't it:

## Changing "Anonymous" to username

You certainly noticed that when you've posted comment, Anonymous is created instead of username.

Let's fix that. If you have column **username** in users table, you can change this line in commontator initializer.

#### config/initializers/commontator.rb

{% highlight ruby %}

config.user_name_proc = lambda { |user| I18n.t('commontator.anonymous') }

{% endhighlight %}

Now add username instead of previous code.

#### config/initializers/commontator.rb

{% highlight ruby %}
config.user_name_proc = lambda { |user| user.username }
{% endhighlight %}

And anonymous is changed to comment's user.

## Customization

Commontator gem allows easy customization. For example let's assume you want to customize Commontator's view:

{% highlight sh %}
rake commontator:copy:views
{% endhighlight %}

This command will create commontator folder in views directory with all files.

That's all for now.

I hope that you've liked my tutorial. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in discussion.
