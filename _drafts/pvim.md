Have you tried Vim, but you found it hard to start and you just quitted it? Do you want to convince your colleague to use Vim?

Until recently, you have hard time. You certainly walked through Vim help system or you found some tutorials online, but real Vim's guide to beginners was really missing.

## Meet Painless Vim

Painless Vim by Nate Dickson is a new beginner's guide to Vim. It promises to help you to get up to speed quickly. Book has 28 chapters and each chapter covers part of Vim step by step.
 
Book is short(166 pages), but it uses it's space perfectly.
 
You will start with basics like navigation commands and what to put to your .vimrc and then you will move to other topics like remapping keys to your taste or tips and tricks for using insert mode.

In some chapters you will find some recommendation what to do and what you should avoid. For example in chapter about mapping keys, you will find out examples which keys you should remap and which you shouldn't.
